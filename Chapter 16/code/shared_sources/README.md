## License
See [license.md](license.md) and licenses within source code for details.

## Repository
This folder is a repository of *shared source code* : most other samples use it as library or directly reference code from it.

It means that you must clone this repository prior to trying those samples that refer to this repository as dependency.

## Folders
* cmake: 'find' files to search for cmake packages
* nvh: helpers to simplify the code of samples.
* nvgl: helpers for OpenGL
* nvvk: helpers for Vulkan (to aid extension use and simplify initialization of Vulkan structs, some files were generated by their corresponding `.lua` files using the VULKAN_SDK)
* nvoptix: helpers for Optix
* nvdx11: helpers for DirectX 11
* nvdx12: helpers for DirectX 12
* nvmath: math library used by most samples
* imgui: a version of [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) and some implementations to render it (derived from its examples).
* noise: several open-source noise or random number generators
* GL/KHR: include files for OpenGL (we use a subset of extensions that is generated and defined by `nvgl/extensions_gl.lua`)
* resources: icons etc.

## Files
* CMakeLists_include.txt: common file that every samples CMakeLists.txt will include
* CMakeLists.txt: project definition for the shared_sources library
* main.h: this is the primary include for samples as they derive from the application window definition.
* main_internal_...: platform and api specific window creation
* resources...: win32 resources
* include_gl.h: shortcut for including the file that contains the GL extension definitions
* platform.h / NvFoundation.h: platform specific `NV_...` macros that aid cross platform coding

## Dependencies
Some samples may rely on few additional libraries in order to compile (mostly for win32). You can find them in [shared_external](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/shared_external). The use of Vulkan or DirectX APIs requires that the appropriate SDKs are installed.

The minimum Vulkan SDK version is currently: 1.2.135.0

## Third Party
This project embeds several open-source libraries and/or code derived from them.

#### GLFW
Some window management functions were taken or derived from glfw.
